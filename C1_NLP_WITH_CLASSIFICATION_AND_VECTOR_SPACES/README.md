**by DeepLearning.AI**

## About this Course
In Course 1 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:   

1. Perform sentiment analysis of tweets using logistic regression and then na√Øve Bayes,
2. Use vector space models to discover relationships between words and use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the vector space and visualize those relationships, and
3. Write a simple English to French translation algorithm using pre-computed word embeddings and locality-sensitive hashing to relate words via approximate k-nearest neighbor search.

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!
