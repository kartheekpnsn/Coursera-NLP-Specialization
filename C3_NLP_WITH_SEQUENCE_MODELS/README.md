**by DeepLearning.AI**

##About this Course
In Course 3 of the Natural Language Processing Specialization, you will:
1. Train a neural network with GLoVe word embeddings to perform sentiment analysis of tweets,
2. Generate synthetic Shakespeare text using a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) language model,
3. Train a recurrent neural network to perform named entity recognition (NER) using LSTMs with linear layers, and 
4. Use so-called ‘Siamese’ LSTM models to compare questions in a corpus and identify those that are worded differently but have the same meaning.

By the end of this Specialization, you will have designed NLP applications that perform question-answering and sentiment analysis, created tools to translate languages and summarize text, and even built a chatbot!
